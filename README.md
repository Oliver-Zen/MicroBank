# Microservices with Spring Boot, Docker, and Kubernetes 🚀

This repository contains my personal implementation and notes as I progress through the [this course](https://www.udemy.com/course/master-microservices-with-spring-docker-kubernetes) by Eazy Bytes and Madan Reddy on Udemy.

## 🎯 Course Overview

The course is a comprehensive deep dive into building **enterprise-grade microservices** using modern technologies and practices including:

- **Java & Spring Boot**
- **Spring Cloud**
- **Docker**
- **Kubernetes**
- **MySQL**
- **Helm**
- **Service Mesh (Istio)**
- **RabbitMQ & Kafka**
- **CI/CD**
